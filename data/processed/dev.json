This antigen / antibody complex is taken up by the B cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides . The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides on its surface MHC class II molecules . This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell , which releases lymphokines and activates the B cell . As the activated B cell then begins to divide , its offspring ( plasma cells ) secrete millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes this antigen . These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph , bind to pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by complement activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes . Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly , by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells .",

An additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person , such as basic necessities like food , water , and healthcare ; while , an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person .

The Geordie dialect has much of its origins in the language spoken by the Anglo - Saxon populations who migrated to and conquered much of England after the end of Roman Imperial rule . This language was the forerunner of Modern English ; but while the dialects of other English regions have been heavily altered by the influences of other foreign languages \u2014 particularly Latin and Norman French\u2014 the Geordie dialect retains many elements of the old language . An example of this is the pronunciation of certain words : \" dead \" , \" cow \" , \" house \" and \" strong \" are pronounced \" deed \" , \" coo \" , \" hoos \" and \" strang \" \u2014 which is how they were pronounced in the Anglo - Saxon language . Other Geordie words with Anglo - Saxon origins include : \" larn \" ( from the Anglo - Saxon \" laeran \" , meaning \" teach \" ) , \" burn \" ( \" stream \" ) and \" gan \" ( \" go \" ) .",

It meets each six months and its President ( currently former Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk ) is meant to ' drive forward its work ' , but it does not itself ' legislative functions ' . The Council does this : in effect this is the governments of the member states , but there will be a different minister at each meeting , depending on the topic discussed ( e.g. for environmental issues , the member states ' environment ministers attend and vote ; for foreign affairs , the foreign ministers , etc . ) . The minister must have the authority to represent and bin the member states in decisions . When voting takes place it is weighted inversely to member state size , so smaller member states are not dominated by larger member states . In total there are 352 votes , but for most acts there must be a qualified majority vote , if not consensus . TEU article 16 ( 4 ) and TFEU article 238 ( 3 ) define this to mean at least 55 per cent of the Council members ( not votes ) representing 65 per cent of the population of the EU : currently this means around 74 per cent , or 260 of the 352 votes .

Ranked positions in the pre-Heian Imperial court were established ; and this organizational structure remained largely intact until the Meiji Restoration ( 1868 ) . In this highly stable hierarchy , the pharmacists\u2014and even pharmacist assistants\u2014were assigned status superior to all others in health - related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists .
